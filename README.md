The ICSP pogo pin adapter is geared toward hobbyists who love to design their own PCB's and program them!
It is specifically designed for Atmel microcontrollers that are programmable via SPI. Below is a list of supported chips:

- ATtiny25/45/85
- ATtiny24/44/84
- ATtiny2313/4313
- ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P
- ATmega328PB (improved version of 328P)
- ATmega640/V-1280/V-1281/V-2560/V-2561/V

Keep in mind there are many other variants, but I've listed the most common and most supported ones. Most variants
vary in terms of flash memory. The first number indicates the flash memory size in KB. For example, ATtiny25 has 2KB
of flash, ATtiny45 has 4KB, and ATtiny85 has 8KB and is the most common.
