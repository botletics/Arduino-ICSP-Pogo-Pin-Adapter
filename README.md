<h1>Arduino ICSP Pogo Pin Adapter</h1>

## Overview

The ISP (or ICSP) pogo pin adapter is geared toward hobbyists who love to design their own PCB's and program them with an Arduino!
It is specifically designed for Atmel microcontrollers that are programmable via SPI and is very useful for
flashing the Arduino bootloader to the chip. The only thing you have to do is design your PCB with six test
point pads placed in a standard 2x3 ICSP configuration with 2.54mm (0.1") spacing.
